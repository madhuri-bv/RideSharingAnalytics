## Project Highlights
- Analyze large NYC taxi datasets efficiently using **PySpark**.
- **Batch pipeline**: processes historical data to generate metrics.
- **Streaming pipeline**: simulates real-time ingestion and transformations.
- Metrics include:
  - Monthly trips & month-over-month (MoM) growth.
  - Monthly revenue & MoM growth.
  - Top 5 pickup zones per month.
  - Cumulative distance per month.
- Dashboard-ready outputs for visualization of trends.

## Project Structure

- **batch_ingestion.py** â€“ Loads raw taxi trip parquet data into Spark DataFrame for batch processing.  
- **transform.py** â€“ Cleans and transforms batch data (adds datetime features, prepares metrics).  
- **aggregate.py** â€“ Generates batch-level aggregates like hourly trips, fare averages, and trip counts.  
- **stream_ingest.py** â€“ Simulates real-time ingestion and streaming analytics using PySpark Structured Streaming.  
- **dashboard/dashboard.py** â€“ Streamlit app visualizing batch and streaming metrics interactively.  
- **requirements.txt** â€“ Python dependencies required to run the project.  
- **README.md** â€“ Project overview and instructions.
